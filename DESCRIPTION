Description: In 2019, UNICEF with the support of the European Union launched a 
    4-year nutrition programme aimed at contributing to recovery efforts for 
    people in need in cyclone-affected districts of Mozambique. Since then, a 
    series of surveys have been conducted by UNICEF and its partners in 
    Mozambique to provide the data needed to monitor progress and assess change 
    in health and nutrition outcomes. This package provides R utilities and 
    tools for performing data cleaning, data processing, and data analysis of 
    these surveys.
