In 2019, UNICEF with the support of the European Union launched a 4-year nutrition programme aimed at contributing to recovery efforts for people in need in cyclone-affected districts of Mozambique. Since then, a series of surveys have been conducted by UNICEF and its partners in Mozambique to provide the data needed to monitor progress and assess change in health and nutrition outcomes. This package provides R utilities and tools for performing data cleaning, data processing, and data analysis of these surveys.
